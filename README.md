To activate the setup run:
```
git clone https://github.com/0xlakshan/dotfiles.git
cd ./dotfiles
cp ./linux/launch.sh ~/
cp ./linux/launch.desktop ~/.local/share/applications
```

The following diagram shows the anatomy of my shell prompt

The custom ```.tmux.conf``` includes mouse support, allowing you to select and copy text using your mouse. It also integrates with the system clipboard via ```xclip```, making it easy to copy content between ```tmux``` and other applications. To ensure this functionality works properly, make sure the required packages ```tmux```, ```vim```, and ```xclip``` are installed on your system.
